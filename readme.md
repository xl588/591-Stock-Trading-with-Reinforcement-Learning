### data.ipynb
This notebook contains some data explorations with the both simulated data and historical data. It also includes the time series analysis metioned in the report.
The code the resourced and edited with various online informations and past class materials.

### nonRLmethod.ipynb
This notebook contains code predicting stock price changes with non RL methods such as RNN, which was planed to be used as a comparison to our RL model, but was not included in the final results.
The code the resourced and edited with various online informations and past class materials.

### real-time.ipynb
In this file, we uses the environment simulation and RL algorithms built with live stock market quote to train our RL agent. The excution results is for illustration.
The code the resourced and edited with various online informations and past class materials.

### RL-witherror.ipynb
This file contains all the codes used for simulating the enviroment and build RL algorithms presented in our project presentation. The excution results shows the KeyboardInterrupt error since the excution was mannuallu interrupted for time manner, since the number of iteration was set to high values. The plots and analysis are based on past excutions and the results stored to the variables before the interrution.
